# Real Estate Wizard

This is a modern web application that helps users find their ideal real estate properties through an intuitive multi-step process. Users can provide a description, an inspirational image, a location, and other details to define their search.

The project is built with React and Vite, and styled with Tailwind CSS.

## Development Setup

1.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

2.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173` (or the next available port).

## Building for Production

To create a production-ready build of the application, run:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will generate a `dist` folder with the optimized static files that can be deployed to any web server.
